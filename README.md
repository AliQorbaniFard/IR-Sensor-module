The video covers every step in detail:

1. **Circuit Explanation** – Understand how the IR sensor works and interacts with other components.
2. **Schematic Design** – Draw the full schematic from scratch.
3. **Custom Footprint Creation** – Learn to build non-standard footprints (e.g. IR receiver module).
4. **PCB Layout & Routing** – Arrange components, route signals, and optimize the design.
5. **Gerber & NC Drill Export** – Generate production-ready files to send to a PCB manufacturer.
